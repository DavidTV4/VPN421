# 🌍 Free VPN – Access from Anywhere

A Free VPN is a service that lets you browse the internet securely and privately by routing your connection through servers in different countries — all without paying for a subscription.

With a free VPN, you can:

- 🔒 **Protect your privacy** – hide your IP address and encrypt your internet traffic.
- 🌐 **Access worldwide content** – connect to servers in different countries to bypass geo-restrictions.
- 💻 **Stay safe on public Wi-Fi** – prevent hackers from intercepting your data.

**Note:** Free VPNs may have speed limits, ads, or fewer server choices than paid ones — but they’re perfect for light browsing and occasional location changes.
